Noisemusick 64 bit Migration notes
---------------------------------
* Update to recommended settings in warnings tab

* To Solve BAD ACCESS in ES1 Renderer: Goto Product->Scheme->Edit->Run->GPU Frame Capture Disabled (might be Xcode beta bug?)

* "Duplicate symbols" generated when updating To Fix:

Click on the project in the right-hand project tree
Select the debug build target in the TARGETS list
Click on the "Build Settings" tab
Search for "No Common Blocks"
Change the setting from "Yes" to "No"

* Ran migration python script
 
* Added core MIDI for Audiobus 3

* HAd to update version and build numbers

* Need to update Deployment target to 8.0 for Xcode 9

* Audiobus needs libz.tbd and Security framework

* If using Mic on iOS11, NSMicrophoneUsageDescription needs a string

* No Audiobus URL was found in this app's Info.plist
ABAudioSenderPort.m:203: You must declare this audio component within your Info.plist's AudioComponents list: ADD url type as described in audiobus docs

* ABAudioSenderPort.m:203: You must declare this audio component within your Info.plist's AudioComponents list

* Add this somewhere?

-(void)audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:(AVAudioPlayer *)player successfully:(BOOL)flag{
  [audioPlayer stop];
  [audioPlayer prepareToPlay];
}

OR

[audioPlayer stop]; [audioPlayer prepareToPlay]; [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:NO error:nil];

* ofXPd generates audio in the audioOut callback FYI

Error with Pd patch:
"failed since it uses garray_getfloatarray while running 64-bit"
Looks like it is in the vefl.h internal
Tracked down to krzYszcz and Cyclone Max extension ports:
https://puredata.info/downloads/cyclone/releases/0.1-alpha57

Updated vefl.c and vefl.h to versions not using array of floats; anything else? 

* LED used this opengl shader:
 [LEDLayer setBlendFunc: (ccBlendFunc) { GL_ONE, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR }];
 
 
* Need to set in Info.plist: App does not run in background from YES->NO

* In order to pass privacy notices, had to remove the following from openframeworks tree:

addons->video
photolibrary access
